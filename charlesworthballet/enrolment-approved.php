<p>Thank you. By making payment your child’s position in the class/es has been secured and your enrolment complete.</p>
<p>Please see below the class etiquette requirements of Charlesworth students:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arrive to class promptly, at least 5 minutes early, allowing time to get into the space and prepared.</li>
	<li>Bring along a labeled drink bottle as it is important that our dancers stay hydrated.</li>
	<li>Use the toilet facilities beforehand to avoid losing valuable time.</li>
	<li>Arrive dressed in the uniform as specified on our website. Please see our Uniform & Grooming policy below</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>“All CBS students are required to attend every class in the full, correct uniform. We recommend that all uniform items are clearly named. Uniform requirements and recommended stockists are listed on the CBS website, https://charlesworthballet.com.au/school/uniforms. CBS takes no responsibility for any lost items. Any items left on CBS premises will be placed in lost property. All girls must wear pink leather ballet shoes with ballet ribbons tied correctly, secured in a knot on the inside of the ankle and the ends tucked in. Teachers are not expected to tie ribbons for students, taking up valuable class time. Teachers may require a student to remain with their parent or carer outside class until they are correctly groomed before entering. All students must attend class with neat hair. Boys’ hair can be held in a ponytail, if long, while short hair must be brushed or combed and may be gelled to hold it off the face. Girls’ hair must be secured in a bun on the crown of the head using a bun net and pins, as well as hair spray or gel to secure. Short hair must be held neatly off the face with a soft fabric Alice band matching the uniform leotard colour. No bows, decorative clips or hairbands may be worn by students. No jewellery, watches or Fitbits may be worn in class, with the exception of Medicalert jewellery. All uniform and grooming queries should be addressed to CBS Admin.”</em></strong></p>
